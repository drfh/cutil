* Components to implement
	- carray
	- cdict
	- cini
	- linked lists
	- btree
	- magnet parse
	- hash functions (MD4,MD5,MD6,SHA1,SHA2,SHA256,...)


*	Use a kind of linked list for quick and easy array expatiation and contraction
*	Threadsafe attributes

*	Future roadmap work
#	Make allocations dynamic
#	Make malloc, free and realloc use a macro
#	Experimental memory blocks for 32 bit addressing on 64 bit hardware
